Those demonstration videos represents the performances of trained models in demo mode. Demonstrator module is used to quickly show 
how the trained agents behave on 7 different mujoco environments.

Environments are selected in the following order:

env_names = ["HalfCheetah-v4", "Hopper-v4", "InvertedDoublePendulum-v4", "InvertedPendulum-v4", "Reacher-v4", "Swimmer-v4", "Walker2d-v4"]

Normally Demonstrator prints episode performances as well, but those demo videos are just for quickly showing the results.

Also I have provided a training-process video shortly showing how training works.

Additionaly I have provided a lunar lander continues v2 environment demo video just for fun.
